  <summary>How I got here: Small Town Robotics</summary><br />
          <p>My family moved to a small lake and farming community west of Detroit in the mid 90's, 2 days before 6th grade, during the industrial automation boom in the 90's. It meant nothing to my blue collar parents, a cook and hair stylist, but it changed the course of my life.<br /><br />
          Signing up for course electives late and not by choice, I ended up filling one of last available seats in a newly minted youund adult robotics program and sent me down a path of mentorship and discorvey in the work of automation.</p>
